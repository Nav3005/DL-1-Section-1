## Section 1: Introduction to Blog Generation using Language Models

### Overview
This section covers the basics of using language models to generate blog content. The focus is on fine-tuning a pre-trained model to generate subheadings for given paragraphs. Web scraping is employed to create a dataset by extracting content from WikiHow.

### Steps
1. **Language Models**: Understand how language models are used for text generation in natural language processing (NLP).
2. **Fine-Tuning**: Learn the process of fine-tuning a pre-trained model for specific tasks like generating subheadings for blog content.
3. **Web Scraping**: Use BeautifulSoup to scrape paragraphs and subheadings from WikiHow and create a dataset.
4. **Dataset Creation**: Compile the scraped data into a CSV file for use in the fine-tuning process.

### Tools Used
- **BeautifulSoup**: Python library for web scraping.
- **Requests**: For making HTTP requests to fetch webpage content.
- **CSV**: To store the scraped data in a structured format.
